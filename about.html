        <p>In just two months Smithereens have burst onto the Cork and Irish rock scene.
            Winning UCC battle of the Bands, with studio time and a Cyprus Avenue Headline gig as prizes,
            means even more momentum for the 5-piece jazz-funk-rock fusion band.
            Sold out gigs in the Roundy, as well as support slots for noise bands such as Bucket show that Smithereens were described as 
            "high energy, fun and one of a kind" by judges at UCC's Battle of the Bands.

            Collectively the five members of Smithereens have over twenty years of gigging experience,
            and are no strangeers to the Cork and Irish live scene.
